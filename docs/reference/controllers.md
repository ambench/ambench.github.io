# Controllers

Controllers live in `source/ambench/ambench/controllers/`. A `ControlPipelineCfg` combines the public action mode, a controller configuration, and Pyroki IK settings for IK-based pipelines; a `RobotProfileCfg` binds that pipeline to one robot.

## Maintained controller families

| Family | Implementation | Role | Typical ID token |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Six-DoF PID | `pid_6dof_ctrl.py` | Tracks position and full orientation for fully actuated bases and the EE oracle | `PID` |
| Four-DoF PID | `pid_4dof_ctrl.py` | Tracks position and yaw for underactuated multirotors | `PID` |
| L1 adaptive | `l1_adaptive_ctrl.py` | Adds adaptive disturbance compensation around the six-DoF tracking structure | `L1` |
| Whole-body MPC | `wholebody_mpc_ctrl.py` | Jointly computes base wrench and arm targets under state and input constraints | `MPC` |
| Joint PID | `pid_joint_ctrl.py` | Tracks arm and gripper joint targets inside robot command application | internal |

Pyroki (`pyroki_ik_ctrl.py`) is an IK front end, not a wrench controller. In an IK–tracking profile it resolves an EE target into base and arm targets; PID or L1 then tracks the base target. The MPC profile performs whole-body resolution within the optimizer and does not use the Pyroki front end.

## Public controller contract

`BaseController.compute(...)` returns `ControllerOutput`. Its stable fields include applied body-frame force and torque, optional arm targets, and optional telemetry for commanded and realized rotor thrust, desired and final wrench, rotor angles, proximity effects, and drag. Controllers expose `reset(...)` for episode-local state such as integrators or adaptive estimates.

The simulator-facing pipeline is:

```text
policy action -> ControlPipeline -> controller -> ControllerOutput -> RobotIO
```

Controller code should not contain task rewards, task success logic, or task reset geometry.

## Physical-effect order

For multirotors, `BaseController.compute(...)` applies inverse allocation and saturation, optional rotor actuator dynamics, proximity effects, forward allocation, drag, and optional wind before returning the realized wrench. See [Physics, Disturbances, and Randomization](../configure/physics-disturbances-and-randomization.md).

## Dependencies

Pyroki and acados are part of the standard AM-Bench installation. Physical EE-target IK profiles use `ext/pyroki`; whole-body MPC uses acados and its generated solver build. The EE oracle remains the appropriate first check for separating task setup from physical-robot controller behavior.

Exact reusable gains, IK constraints, MPC settings, rotor actuator fields, and aerodynamic defaults are listed in [Configuration Reference](configuration.md). Use [Controllers and Control Pipelines](../configure/controllers-and-control-pipelines.md) for selection and tuning guidance.
